step 1: step-44-firstPiola.cc 
        needs to derive P_iso and A 
        ***confusing.
step 2: step-44-growth.cc
        needs to rework everything. All derivations are w.r.t F_e, but then transformation between configurations are through F.
        ***confusing.
step 3: step-38-surface-core-firstPiola.cc and step-38-surface-core-Kirchhoff.cc
